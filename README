ESA - Event Sourced Actors
===

Very fast, modular framework for creating asynchronous programs. Light weight, 100% Java framework with no external dependencies.


Exectors                -   2million messages/second
Thread switching actors -  16m mps
Thread pinned actors    - 160m mps

Actors:
  Actors are based on asynchronous processing of code.
  Simplify reasoning about concurrent code by serializing all access to the actor.
  Very fast because it can fetch multiple 'jobs' within one small synchronized block.
  Pinning actors to a single thread can remove all synchronization entirely, really speeding up the code.

Event Source Actors:
  Persistent version of Actors.
  The input and output queues for the actor are journaled to disk or a db.
  Assuming that the actors methods are fully deterministic, then replaying the same events in the same order will always
  reach the same state.
  The journaled events can be trimmed as and when a snapshot of the actor's state is persisted.
