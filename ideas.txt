new library: bcUnit  (Backwards Compatibility Unit Testing)
-------

maintain a versioned definition file, and during unit testing ensure that the latest definition is backwards compatible
with it.

recommended use case: verifying rpc support is backwards compatible

does not extend to foreward/backward compatibility of persistence tiers


Cache Mosaic: Lite weight, high performance, modular caching solution with no external dependencies
JobQueue Mosaic (jqMosaic): Lite weight, high performance job queueing solution with no external dependencies




ESA - Event Sourced Actors

Provides a lite weight, 100% Java, actor solution built on top of super fast jqMosaic with optional
local persistence/robustness provided via event sourcing/journalling the actor's job queues.

- journaled in and out queues
- snapshoted state capture used to clear journals
(supports local disk, cassandra and hive)

Clustered ESA

- Distribute persistent actors across a cluster of JVMs.
- supports clean rollbacks via two step rolling releases:
   - release upgraded schema, must support current system and next version of system
   - deploy next version of system (may be rolled back)
   - once happy, release next version of schema that the current version of system must support (may no longer rollback system)

provide unit testing tools for checking version compatibility of schema
