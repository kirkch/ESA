Actors provide asynchronise access to a data structure. They linearize access to the data structure and reduce the amount
of overhead required to access the data structure by batching multiple calls into few lock calls.

Overhead is reduced in two ways, thus maximising throughput of the system. Firstly calls to the actor are stored in a queue,
which in the case of a backlog of messages will allow the actor to pull multiple matches as once. Limiting the amount of
concurrency coordination required. The second mechanism provides a bigger boost by removing all coordination overheads by
allowing actors assigned to the same thread to coordinate with no locking at all.
